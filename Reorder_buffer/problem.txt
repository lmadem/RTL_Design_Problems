RTL Design Practice: Reorder Buffer [ROB] used in out-of-order CPUs.
Ending the weekend on a high! This is a great practice design problem.
Design a ROB with a valid/ready input interface along with the data and associated ID.
The output interface is also valid and ready, with the data being output in order. 

Ex: If we take ID from 0:7, then ID can come in any random order, but the output data associated with it will go out in strict order from 0 to 7.

Assumed Valid/ready interface naming
 // Upstream interface naming
[valid_in, data_in, idx, ready_out]
 // downstream interface naming
[valid_out, data_out, ready_in]
