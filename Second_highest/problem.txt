Weekend RTL design practice. :-) 
Design a logic that outputs unique second largest number seen in input stream.
// input
valid: 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1
data: 10 5 4 7 9 11 11 12
// output
O/P: - - - 4 7 9 10 10 11
valid: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 

input interface take valid and data, similarly output interface outputs data along with valid.
Requirement Clarification:
- we want second largest in all unique inputs seen so far
- anytime input data is valid, the design should accept it.
